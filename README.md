About:
I noticed some gaps between the clients and architects in this modern world which can be filled with the technology we have.

1.	Creative people like architects will always be creating various designs. But, there is no place to put them up for sale or know the taste of clients to improve future designs. 
2.	Every client should meet the architect in person to give the details regarding the construction site or architect must be there at site to take the details, then start working on the plans.

To fill-up these gaps we built an e-Commerce platform for Architects.

•	It helps the architects to sell architectural designs. 

•	Get rating for each design based on which architect can plan future designs. 

•	Create plans for different constructions without visiting the construction site. 

•	Built a discussion forum where problems of different clients can be discussed. 

•	A suggestion-box which helps architect to receive feedback.

Technologies used:

•	Developed the front-end of the project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

•	Designed back-end and database connections using JSP.

•	Worked on design and creation of database using ORACLE.
